This is a Java Client for the Khan Academy API.

For more details of how this API works please see the API <a href="https://github.com/Khan/khan-api/">GitHub repository</a>

This is not an official client for the API, it's an unofficial project to makes easy work with the API.

It is a <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html">Maven project</a>, which means you can build it using the following command:

<code>mvn clean package</code>

It is implement on top of <a href="http://www.mastertheboss.com/web-interfaces/378-resteasy-client-api-tutorial.html">RESTEasy Client API</a>.

The next steps for this project are:

- Create a documentation showing how to use it(by while you can see the tests);
- Extend the wrapper;

A continuous work also should be done to keep the wrapper up to date with the Khan Academy API.
